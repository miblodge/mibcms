Installation is fairly straight forward, except for creating users.

1. Create and modify config file...
* Make a copy of config/example_local.php called config/local.php
* Fill in the database settings. 
* It is probably best to override the default password salt.
* Check in config/default.php to see if there is any other setting you want to tweak. 
If so, add the line to config/local.php so it won't get overwritten on upgrade later.

2. Configure you authentication file...
* We'll assume you have left the default authentication of 'self' as 'Elgg' has not
been tested for a few years.
* Make a copy of auth/self/example_config called auth/self/config.php

3. Open a browser to the site URL/install.php
* Click create all the tables.

4. Creating users...
Here is where things get tricky. You'll need to insert two records 
for each user (unless you got the Elgg auth option working somehow
and authenticate from an Elgg install, and then you just need one).

* Manually insert a record into the `user` table. Easy enough.
* Manually insert a record into the `auth` table. More tricky as 
you'll need to hash the password manually. Using the same salt.
This version was written years ago so it still uses md5. I'll
update that later, but for now create a temporary php file and
get the hash like:

$password ='whatever';
$salt = 'whatever';
echo md5($password.$salt);

Yeah, yeah, I need to upgrade to something better than md5 and add
user creation support and add the first user in the install script.
I know...
